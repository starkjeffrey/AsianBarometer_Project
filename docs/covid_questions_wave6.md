## Summary Statistics

### Key Findings for Cambodia (Wave 6, 2020)

**Impact**:
- 8.6% reported family COVID infection
- 66.4% reported serious/very serious economic impact

**Government Response**:
- 83.5% high trust in government COVID information
- 90.9% positive evaluation of government pandemic handling

**Vaccination**:
- 90.7% vaccination rate (very high)

### Conceptual Groupings

1. **COVID Impact** (2 questions): q138, q140
2. **Government Trust & Response** (2 questions): q141, q142
3. **Vaccination** (2 questions): q144, q145
4. **Democratic Rights vs. Public Health** (3 questions): q172a, q143a, q143e

## Analytical Notes

### Comparability
- These questions are **Wave 6 only** - no cross-wave comparison possible
- Data collected during COVID-19 pandemic (2020)
- Reflects early pandemic period attitudes and experiences

### Measurement Quality
- High non-response is rare (mostly <5%)
- Some skip patterns (e.g., q145 only for unvaccinated)
- Clear response scales with consistent missing value codes

### Research Potential

**Possible Analyses**:
1. Relationship between COVID trust (q141) and general institutional trust
2. Economic impact (q140) and democratic support trade-offs (q143a, q143e)
3. Government evaluation (q142) and willingness to accept emergency powers (q172a)
4. Personal infection (q138) and attitudes toward public health measures

**Limitations**:
- Cross-sectional only (no time series)
- Cambodia-specific (no cross-national comparison in W6)
- Pandemic context may not generalize to other crises

## Variable Name Patterns

All COVID questions have recognizable patterns:
- **q138-q145**: COVID-specific block
- **q143a, q143e**: Government justification series (COVID context)
- **q172a**: Emergency powers series (COVID example)

## Adding to Concept Mappings

These should be added to `concept_mappings.csv` with:
- Domain: `covid` (new domain)
- Only W6 columns filled
- Notes: "Wave 6 only - pandemic questions"
